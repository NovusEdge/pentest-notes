# The OSI Model

| Layer | Name         | Function                                                    |
| ----- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 7     | Application  | User-level APIs, resource sharing, remote file access       |
| 6     | Presentation | Data translation, encryption, and decryption                |
| 5     | Session      | Interhost communication, managing sessions                  |
| 4     | Transport    | End-to-end connections, reliability, flow control           |
| 3     | Network      | Path determination, IP, routing                             |
| 2     | Data Link    | Physical addressing, error handling, MAC                    |
| 1     | Physical     | Physical medium, hardware transmission, binary transmission |

Here's a table that lists common network devices associated with each layer of the OSI model:

| Layer | Name          | Common Devices |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| 7     | Application   | Gateway, Proxy Server, Network-based Applications |
| 6     | Presentation  | Gateway, Multimedia Devices |
| 5     | Session       | Gateway, Firewalls, Network Controllers |
| 4     | Transport     | Gateway, Load Balancers |
| 3     | Network       | Router, Layer 3 Switch, Multilayer Switch |
| 2     | Data Link     | Switch, Bridge, Network Interface Card (NIC) |
| 1     | Physical      | Hub, Repeater, Cable, Fiber Optics, Patch Panel |

## Encapsulation
Here's a summarized explanation of the encapsulation and de-encapsulation processes in the OSI model:
#### Encapsulation Process
- **Adding Layer-Specific Information:** As data moves down through the OSI layers, each layer adds its own header (and sometimes a trailer) to the data. This added information is specific to the functions of each layer.
- **Layer Examples:**
  - **Network Layer:** Adds headers including source and destination IP addresses.
  - **Transport Layer:** Adds headers with protocol-specific information (TCP or UDP).
  - **Data Link Layer:** Adds a trailer to the data for integrity checks, enhancing security and ensuring data is not corrupted.
- **Data Naming:**
  - **Layers 7, 6, 5 (Application, Presentation, Session):** The data is referred to as 'data'.
  - **Layer 4 (Transport):** The data is called a 'segment' (TCP) or 'datagram' (UDP).
  - **Layer 3 (Network):** The data is termed a 'packet'.
  - **Layer 2 (Data Link):** The data becomes a 'frame'.
  - **Layer 1 (Physical):** The data is transmitted as 'bits'.
#### De-encapsulation Process
- **Removing Layer Information:** When data is received, the process is reversed. Starting from the physical layer, each layer strips off its corresponding header (and trailer) as the data moves up the OSI model.
- **Restoring Original Data:** By the time the data reaches the application layer, all added headers and trailers are removed, leaving the original data.
#### Importance
- **Standardization:** Encapsulation and de-encapsulation provide a standardized method for data transmission across different devices and networks.
- **Interoperability:** This standardization ensures that any network-enabled device can communicate with another, regardless of manufacturer, operating system, or other differences.

# Networking Tools
### `ping`
The ping command is used when we want to test whether a connection to a remote resource is possible.

Usage:
```shell-session
user@system:~$ ping ADDRESS
```
### `traceroute`
`traceroute` can be used to map the path your request takes as it heads to the target machine.

Usage:
```shell-session
user@system:~$ traceroute ADDRESS
```
### `whois`
`whois` essentially allows you to query who a domain name is registered to. In Europe personal details are redacted; however, elsewhere you can potentially get a great deal of information from a `whois` search.

Usage:
```shell-session
user@system:~$ whois ADDRESS
```

### `dig`
`dig` allows us to manually query recursive DNS servers of our choice for information about domains.

Usage:
```shell-session
user@system:~$ dig DOMAIN @DNS_SERVER

## Neat example for getting your public IP:
user@system:~$ dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com
```
