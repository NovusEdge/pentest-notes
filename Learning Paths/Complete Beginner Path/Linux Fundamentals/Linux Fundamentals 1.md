## Using `find`

For the full manpage, just run `man find`. Some fundamental searching commands:
```shell-session
user@system:~$ find -name "filename.txt"

## The "*" wildcard matches any characters. 
## So the following matches any text file
user@system:~$ find -name "*.txt"
```

## Using `grep`

`grep` is short for: `g/re/p` from the `ed` editor stuff. It also stands for: _Global Regular Expression Parser_. It's quite simple to use:
```shell-session
user@system:~$ grep REGULAR_EXPRESSION FILE(S)
```

> [!info] There's a lot more when it comes to Linux commands, so be sure to keep a file that has the important ones stated and explained. 

## I/O Redirection

|Symbol / Operator|Description|
|---|---|
|&|This operator allows you to run commands in the background of your terminal.|
|&&|This operator allows you to combine multiple commands together in one line of your terminal.|
|>|This operator is a redirector - meaning that we can take the output from a command (such as using cat to output a file) and direct it elsewhere.|
|>>|This operator does the same function of the `>` operator but appends the output rather than replacing (meaning nothing is overwritten).|
