## Processes and Jobs

A process, in the simplest terms, is just some program running on the system.
A **job** is a program managed by the shell. A job may consist of one or more _processes_. 
- `Ctrl-C`: Kill the process running in the foreground by sending the signal `SIGINT`
- `Ctrl-Z`: Suspend the process running in the foreground by sending the signal `SIGTSTP`
- [_`jobs`_](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/jobs.1p.html): Display a list of the jobs with their status
- [_`fg`_](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/fg.1p.html): Move a background job into the foreground
- [_`bg`_](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/bg.1p.html): Resume suspended jobs by running them as background jobs

##### SIGHUP Signal
- **SIGHUP** stands for "Signal Hang UP".
- It's a signal sent to a process when its controlling terminal is closed. This often happens when a user logs out of a shell session.
- By default, the process that receives this signal will terminate. This is because, historically, the loss of a connection to a terminal (or "hang up") meant the process couldn't continue.
- However, many daemons and long-running processes are designed to handle `SIGHUP` differently, often to reload their configuration files.

##### The `nohup` Command
- **`nohup`** stands for "No Hang UP".
- It's a command used to run another command, telling it to ignore the `SIGHUP` signal. This allows the command to continue running even after the user has logged out.
- For example, `nohup ./my_script &` will start `my_script` in the background, and `my_script` will not terminate when the user logs out or closes the terminal.
- `nohup` is often used for long-running processes in scripts and automation.
